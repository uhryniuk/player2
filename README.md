# Server Tasks

- [x] Rework RouterInfo for pretty printing paths and methods.
    - Required to get server compiling again.
- [x] Add more structured logging.
    - I have a link for a PROD level config.
    - But for the most part, just do basic level config.
- [ ] Clean up config and have valid options for hostname and ports.
- [ ] Clean up HttpServer, it's a real mess.


# Notes
- Don't try to map knowledge from other languages 1-1 in rust.
    - Just read docs, and learn fresh. The language is very terse.
